## Contributions
I have created this project with the purpose to exercise my Ruby on Rails skills, mainly testing, which I'm currently more focused.

**NOTE:** at the moment the tests are quite broken and incomplete, because I'm still figuring out to the the things working. After I have a minimal feature set, I will work on them.

If have comments or suggestions please let me know, as my only purpose is to improve.
See bellow on how to contact me.
